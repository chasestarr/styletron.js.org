**Styletron is an universal toolkit for component-oriented styling**. It falls into the [CSS in JS](https://github.com/tuchk4/awesome-css-in-js) category. Styletron works great with [React](https://reactjs.org/) but can be used with any other framework or plain JS as well.

## Example

```jsx live
import { styled } from "styletron-react";

export default () => {
  // Create a styled component by passing
  // an element name and a style object
  const Anchor = styled("a", {
    fontSize: "20px",
    color: "red"
  });
  return <Anchor href="/getting-started">Start!</Anchor>;
};
```

Styletron provides [styletron-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styletron-react) with some handy React utilities. In the example above, we use the `styled` function to create a styled React component.

What is happening behind the scene? Styletron processes the style object and creates a new class name:

```html
<head>
  <style>
    .b3 {
      font-size: 20px;
    }
    .cb {
      color: red;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

**The class names are auto-generated**. You don't have to come up with names! Since Styletron uses the `<style />` tag, you could use **media queries** and other selectors as well. You could not do that with inline styles! Check [Concepts](/concepts) for more info.

Then, the `Anchor` component is created and its `className` prop is set to `".b3 .cb"`.

## Features

### Performance

**Styletron generates styles only when absolutely needed**. This concept is also known as [critical rendering path](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/). This means that your browser never needs to process CSS rules that are not being used. Styletron does the declaration-level de-duplication known as [Atomic CSS](https://acss.io/). **It dramatically reduces the redundancy of CSS rules**. Also, Styletron is pretty compact and will add less than 8kB (gzip) to your bundle.

### No extra tooling required

If you want to make sure that your CSS scales well with the size of application, you might need to reach for some additional tooling. For example, a comparable approach called [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) requires you to use Webpack and its [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader). To improve the developer experience even further, many projects also rely on post/pre-processing with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss) or [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).

On the other hand, using Styletron means adding just an additional NPM module into your project. **It doesn't require any specific compiler, bundler or complicated setup**.

### Portability

Your styles are written in JavaScript and co-located with your components. **It is the same developer experience as using inline styles but without any drawbacks**. You can use standard modularization and code-splitting techniques. As long as your application has Styletron installed, everything works!

There are many other benefits that CSS in JS brings. For more context, you can check the [React: CSS in JS](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js) presentation.
